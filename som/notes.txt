Issues with implementing SOM in SOM:

1. Strings aren't comparable, which is needed for the 'range' parser.
Using hashCode of first character instead.

2. No asDouble method on String.

3. No array literals with expressions.




Improvement Ideas:

Very Easy (could be done in v1):

1. Support array indexing syntax which is converted to at: and at:set:.
Ex. a[1] -> a at: 1  and a[1]: 42 -> a at: 1 set: 42

2. Support Java/Js style comments, with nesting, instead of "" comments.

3. Replace | x y z | local variable declaration with something like 'let' or 'var'
so you can initialize when declaring.

4. Add Smalltalk '.' syntax, which would make constructors easier to write.

5. Standardize assignment syntax: ie. fn = ( ... ) vs var := ( ... ).
Make always just use ':'.

6. Rename 'self' to 'this' to be more familiar to Java/JS developers.

7. Add perl-style multi-line strings with user specified delimiter to avoid
ever having to escape the terminator. Simpler syntax than perl would be XML-ish:
<string opt-delim>
  blah blah blah
  </string>, not an issue because it didn't have the same opt-delim
</string opt-delim>


Later Versionss:

8. Add 'char' support.

9. Add optional typing and have it affect method selection.

10. Replace instance variables with properties. Would get rid of implicit context
which could then be used for 'self'.

11. Remove 'classdef' from language and just create instances of Class directly.

12. Superfly the types.

13. Add Axioms and major axiom types.

14. Some way to capture a block's AST for interpretation as an mlang rather than
directly execute.

15. Concurrency.

16. Replace global variables with packages and requires:.
